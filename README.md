# Ideas
Noting down some of the ideas that we think could have practical implications. 

1. Hand Gesture Based Translator
This could be a  device to communicate with deaf and dumb people. It could translate hand gestures to language and vice versa. 

2. Professional Services for hire
I personally face this issue where I find it difficult to get trust worthy and reliable house hold help. 
Why not create an open source platform to register, get IDed and reviews tracked.. 

3. Interview helper
app to help me get through an interview. I havent seen a good companion app so far.. 

4. Hybrid Lambda Architecutre with multiple Cloud Service Providers.
